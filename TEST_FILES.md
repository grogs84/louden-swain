# Test Files

The following test files were created during the development process to validate the wrestler API fixes:

## `/tmp/comprehensive_test.py`
Comprehensive validation test that verifies all wrestler API improvements work correctly:
- Enhanced wrestler list query returns real data instead of null values
- Individual wrestler endpoints provide complete information
- Statistics calculations use actual match data
- Match history queries work properly
- Code quality improvements are in place
- Legacy files have been removed

## Usage
```bash
cd /home/runner/work/louden-swain/louden-swain
python /tmp/comprehensive_test.py
```

This test validates that the wrestler service API inconsistencies have been successfully resolved.
